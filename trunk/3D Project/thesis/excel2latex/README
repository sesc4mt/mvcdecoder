                              Excel2LaTeX
                             =============
                                 v2.1

It's difficult to create tables in LaTeX, especially if some columns are
calculated. Excel2LaTeX allows you to transform the current selection from Excel
to Latex.

Text formatting (bold, italic) is retained and multi-column cells are supported.
Border lines can be retained, or replaced with the style of formatting
recommended by the booktabs package. The generated LaTeX code can also be placed
in a floating table environment.

The LaTeX code can be copied to the clipboard or saved as a LaTeX file, which
then can be included in an existing LaTeX document using the \input command.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just open the file Excel2LaTeX.xla in Excel. Then you will have an additional
menu item in your 'Tools' menu and a new Toolbar with one button on it. If you
plan to use the program frequently you can save it in your addin directory and
add it with tools/add-in. This way it will be loaded whenever excel is opened. 


USAGE
~~~~~
Just select the table to convert and hit the button. You will be given the
option to save the result to a file, or send it to the clipboard (so you can
paste it on your Latex editor).


ANNOTATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bold and italic are regognized as long as whole cell is in bold or italic.
* Alignment formats (right,left,center) will be recognized for the whole column
  (not for individual cells).
* Font sizes are not supported, because they are handled completely different in
  TeX.
* Mutlicolumn cells are supported. For this you have to merge the cells in Excel
  using the format/cells menu and selecting the alignment tab. Note however that
  cells merged across rows will not be handled properly.
* The characters %, &, and $ are automatically replaced by LaTeX macros
  (e.g. \%), while \, $, _, and ^ can optionally be replaced.
* You can put additional LaTeX formatting commands in the Excel cells, so you 
  don't have to edit the output, if you want some special chars or formats.
* The default file name for export is the name of the selected range (if it has
  one), otherwise it will be the active excel worksheet.
