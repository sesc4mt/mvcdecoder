what is it for
    3D-TV (targeting World Cup)

the whole process
    MPEG2 n-way video
        |
        V
    realtime encoding to H.264 or MVC
        |
        V
    p2p streaming
        |
        V
    realtime parallel decoding to 2-way video <- MY PROJECT
        |
        V
    restoring 8-way signal from 2-way

choices
    only 2-way video GPU-based parallel decoding algorithm
    (preferred)MVC encoding & decoding

foundations
    scheduling algorithm ready for intel, cell, etc. platforms
    MVC standard encoding and decoding code(low efficiency)
    serial version fast encoding and decoding by Nokia

what i actually do
    parallel decoding algorithm on a certain platform (CUDA) and optimization

further work
    combine all the modules in the process above for a real demo

what for now
    H.264 encoding and decoding technique (books sponsored by lab)
    MVC overview papers (in English) and some previous work in the lab (in Chinese)
    read the Nokia decoding code
    learn to use the development platform
    learn to programming with CUDA

hardware support
    nvidia gtx28x
    samsung 3d tv
    nvidia 3d kit (to be bought recently)

data sources
    MVC testing series
    self made clips with 16 cams
    3-d cam kit with 2 cameras (to be bought next semester)

time
    3 months: start of mar - early june
        start
            what to do?
            what are the result(s) or effect i am about to achieve?
            how am i going to do that?
        mid
            is the current solution the right one?
            how much has been done?
            how far is it from the targeted results?
            is it possible to reach the targeted results in time?
        final
            what i actually did...
    weekly report by each undergraduate
    info about the actual code -> Hu Weidong
