Cube Demo - Keith Ditchburn 2008 (alterd by Harry)

This demo provides example code of setting up a Windows API program and using Direct3D 
to render a cube to the screen. Use this in conjunction with the site notes.

CubeDemo.cpp contains all the Windows API code while the CGraphics class contains
all the Direct3D code.

Note that this demo uses Windows resources to show off how to use them (dialog, icons etc)
however for a full screen game you will not be able to use these resources.

Note:
Press 1,2 to Move Eye -+X
Press 3,4 to Move Eye -+Y
Press 5,6 to Move Eye -+Z

Press Space to Toggle movement

Note:
I'm just begining to learn about 3D rendering and stereo viewing.

My inspiriation has been all the great code posted at http://nehe.gamedev.net/
