Recent work:
	selected a 960x720 video clip
		error decoding with MVCDecoder
	code level optimization
		320x240 8-way 26344ms -> 23813ms
						i.e.	23.65fps -> 26.16fps

Target: 720x576 2-way single thread 30fps on a dual-core

todo1: 960x720 -> 720x576 then try decoding again
todo2: diff decoding results of ffmpeg and JMVC
todo3: is the framework of ffmpeg and mvcdecoder the same
todo4: test the speed of the ffmpeg without output or on a ramdisk

report: the correctness and speed of ffmpeg
